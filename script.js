// Is the same as doing...
// const flightNum = flight; // flight is just a primitive type(a string) and flightNum is a COPY of original value and simply not the ORIGINAL value! flightNum is a complete different variable and has nothing to do with the flight variable which is defined outside of the function!

// const passenger = jonas; // we changed the passenger name and the jonas object was affected too! why that happened? when we pass a reference type to a function, what is copied, is really just a reference to the object in heap memory, but the both points to the same object in the memory! that's why, when we are manipulating passenger object, is the same exactly as we manipulating the jonas object directly, because both of them points to the same object in the heap memory(both are the same object in the heap memory!) => what we change in the copy will happen in the original too! => WE HAVE TO BE AWARE OF THAT!!!!

/* IS THERE ANY PASS BY REFERENCE OR PASS BY VALUE IN JS? */
// THERE IS ONLY PASS BY VALUE IN JS AND THERE IS NO PASS BY REFERENCE IN JS although we pass a reference to the function but this reference is also a VALUE which contains the memory address of the object! we pass A reference to the function but we do not pass BY reference and this is a VERY IMPORTANT DISTINCTION which happen in OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES LIKE C++!

  console.log(`Transformed string: ${fn(str)}`); // Transformed string: JAVASCRIPT is the best!

// BOTH upperFirstWord AND oneWord ARE CALLBACK FUNCTIONS, BECAUSE WE DON'T CALL THEM NOW, RATHER, THE JS WILL CALL THEM LATER BACK, THAT'S WHY THEY ARE CALLED CALL BACK FUNCTIONS! CALL THEM BACK(LATER) HAPPENS IN LINES 109(fn(str)) IN WHICH fn() CAN BE EITHER upperFirstWord OR oneWord GENERIC FUNCTIONS!

// THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME THAT WE HAD EARLIER WITH addEventListener() AS FOLLOWING:
const high5 = () => {
  console.log("ðŸ‘‹"); // ðŸ‘‹ => as soon as we CLICK on the body, the high5 callback function will be called and we will see the waving hand on the console!
};

// addEventListener() which is high-order function is like transformer() and high5 is callback function like upperFirstWord or oneWord which will call back later by JS AS SOON AS WE CLICK ON THE BODY!

document.body.addEventListener("click", high5);

// ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CALLBACK FUNCTION USING foreach() loop:
// ["Jonas", "Martha", "Adam"].forEach(high5);
["Jonas", "Martha", "Adam"].forEach(high5); // 3 ðŸ‘‹ three times waving due to three element in the array! => for each of the element in the array, high5 callback function will be called!

// NOTE: JS uses callbacks all the time!

// LET'S DO THE OPPOSITE OF THE CALLBACK FUNCTION WHICH IS FUNCTION RETURNING FUNCTION:
console.log(
  "OPPOSITE OF THE CALLBACK FUNCTION => FUNCTION RETURNING NEW FUNCTION"

// BELOW, ONE ARROW FUNCTION RETURNS ANOTHER ARROW FUNCTION:
const greet = (greeting) => {
  // return a new arrow function
  return (name) => {
    console.log(`${greeting} ${name}`);
  };
};

// Our first function here(greet) returns a new function which is stored in greeterHey variable and then we can call this variable containing the new function with different parameters!
const greeterHey = greet("Hey");
greeterHey("Jonas"); // Hey Jonas
greeterHey("Steven"); // Hey Steven

// OR CALL ALL OF THEM IN ONE GO:
greet("Hallo")("Jonas");

  book(flightNum, name) {

// book(23, "Sarah Williams"); // Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'airline') BECAUSE this KEYWORD POINTS TO undefined!

// IT MEANS THE this KEYWORD DEPENDS HOW IT IS CALLED: WHEN INSIDE AN OBJECT IS CALLED, POINTS TO THE OBJECT ITSELF, BUT WHEN INSIDE A REGULAR FUNCTION IS CALLED, IT POINTS TO THE UNDEFINED!

// HOW TO SAY TO JS, WHEN I WANT TO BOOK A FLIGHT WITH LUFTHANSA, this KEYWORD REFER TO LAUFTHANSA OBJECT AND WHEN I WANT TO BOOK A FLIGHT WITH EUROWINGS, this KEYWORD REFERS TO THE EUROWINGS OBJECT:
// A function is an object and object has method, therefore a function can have method too and call method is one of them:
// the first argument is this keyword points to which object: Lufthansa or eurowings
// the second, third and other arguments are the rest arguments respectively!

// THIS WILL NOT WORK -  WE USE call() to solve this problem - ist unten:
// book(23, "Sarah Williams"); // Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'airline') BECAUSE this KEYWORD POINTS TO undefined!

// MANUALLY MANUPULATING this KEYWORD USING call METHOD:
book.call(eurowings, 23, "Sarah Williams");

console.log(swiss);

console.log("---------------------------apply method-----------------");
// A similar method to the call method which is called APPLY METHOD:
// APPLY METHOD does exactly the same like call method but it takes the arguments which come after OBJECT which is referring to this keyword as an ARRAY:
const flightData = [583, "George Cooper"];
book.apply(swiss, flightData);
console.log(swiss);

// NOTE: BUT WE DON'T USE THE APPLY METHOD IN MODERN JS ANYMORE.
// IN MODERN JS, WE USE STILL THE CALL METHOD PLUS SPREAD OPERATOR:
// We use spread operator to unpack the data from array and these data are exactly the arguments that we need after first argumnet!

book.call(swiss, ...flightData);
// this is exactly equal with this one: book.call(swiss, 583, "George Cooper");
console.log(swiss);
