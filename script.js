// HOW TO SAY TO JS, WHEN I WANT TO BOOK A FLIGHT WITH LUFTHANSA, this KEYWORD REFER TO LAUFTHANSA OBJECT AND WHEN I WANT TO BOOK A FLIGHT WITH EUROWINGS, this KEYWORD REFERS TO THE EUROWINGS OBJECT:
// A function is an object and object has method, therefore a function can have method too and call method is one of them:

// what we did already: book.call(eurowings, 23,'Sarah Williams');
const bookEW = book.bind(eurowings); // bind method create a new function with 'this' keyword set to eurowings!
// Bind Method WILL NOT CALL THE book FUNCTION, INSTEAD IT WILL RETURN A NEW FUNCTION IN WHICH THE 'this' KEYWORD IS ALWAYS SET TO THE eurowings!
